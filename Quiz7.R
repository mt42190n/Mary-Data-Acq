# 1. When you are combined data that has two different formats for date, using 
  #  regular expression would be less work than using string funtions. One example
  #  is using "." to represent a character, therefore (....)-(..)-(..) can easily
  #  get you YYYY MM DD

# 2. R Markdown is a practicle way to keep track of your progress and work while 
  #  putting it in a presentable format for a presentation or report.The R chunk 
  #  aspect allows the output of codes you choose to be present in the final 
  #  document. It's this practicality that makes R Markdown a tool for 
  #  reproducible research.

# 3. The correlation you determine from a scatterplot assumes that those two 
  #  variables on the graph are isolated. When conducting a study and gathering
  #  data you must keep in mind other factors. The example of checking number of 
  #  hours studied with final exam grade. Perhaps those students who studied 
  #  more are smarter to begin with and that is really why they got the good grade.

# 4. We use variable coding to turn qualitative data into quantitative data. At
  #  my old job we conducted a blind peer review for a research grant and we had to 
  #  code all the names into numbers to make sure no one knew who they were reviewing 
  #  and no one knew who reviewed them (except the research team).
