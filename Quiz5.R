# 1. Data Tidying

# 2. Each variable forms a column and each 
  #  observation forms a row.

# 3. Column Headers are values instead of variable names
  #  One observational unit is stored in multiple tables
  #  More than one observational unit is stored in a single table
  #  More than one variable is stored in a column
  #  Variables are stored in rows and column

# 4. Filter=to extract or dwindle down the data to what is needed for the main focus
  #  Transform=to add or remove variables; to adjust or rearrange the format
  #  Aggregate=to merge or group variables into one
  #  Sort=to change the order or sequence of the rows

# 1. dplyr is faster and easier to use; it has a lot of convenient and useful functions. 
  #  However, dplyr can only be used with dataframes.Also, dplyr allows you to chain your

# 2. With apply, you have to know exactly which function to use. plyr is intuitive, does 
  #  the complete split-apply-combine, and summarizes the results for you. Essentially, 
  #  plyr is much more user friendly.
